## All my uttering in one place

I've been writing and commenting on primarily Continuous Delivery, DevOps, Configuration Management and versions control stuff and lean approaches in software development for many years.

(and public tenders and leadership, and startup business models and ...many things – really)

Over the years these writings ended up in different locations as I worked in different contexts:

- **KruseControl** (2001 - 2007)
- **Praqma** (2007 -2019)
- **DOC – DevOps Culture** (2017 - 20019)
- **Prolike** (2017 - 2020)
- **Inc Inc** (2020 - 2024)
- **Lakruzz.com** (2016 – ...)
- **KEA dev** (2023)
- **The Tech Collective's Tech That Club** (2024)
- **LinkedIn Articles** (2003 – ...)

This project is an effort to clean up – capture some of the good stuff and throw out what isn't relevant any more. I'm gathering it all on [lakruzz.com](https://lakruzz.com) and adding a few re-issue remarks here and there.

## The source is open
This repository on github is open for everyone to examine. 

Over the years I've built quite a handful of utilities, tools, optimizations, workflows, templates etc. and this repo also becomes an use case for some of these tools.

## Chip in!
