### Task sizes are too big

It seems tasks are defined on a product level, focusing on features and functionality.
We didn't go into great detail on task grooming, but we noticed feature branches lived for days, up to weeks.
This is a common indicator for overly big tasks.

If tasks aren't groomed and split up into workable chunks, not only do you risk introducing great technical debt due to lack of solution design, you also make proper task estimation and prioritization impossible.

#### Start grooming the stories into smaller chunks (S)

Product owners own the stories on the backlog, and as a developer in a CI/CD world, you want to break them down into manageable chunks that can be verified independently.

Pour your larger feature requests into epics and break them down into many small stories.
Stories should _never_ span multiple sprints or releases.
Try to groom tasks down into chunks that can be achieved in at most a single working day.
