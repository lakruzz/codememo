### Access to production like environments is limited

It's currently a tedious and manual task to get a robot available for testing. 
It must be reserved with stickers and can only run attended due to lack of shielding. 
Not only does this slow down your developers, it also means the pipeline's verification cannot be automated.

#### Set up a lab for unattended robots (C)

It's vital that developers can automatically get feedback from production like environments.
Set up a lab where provided robots, or the relevant parts thereof, can run unattended at any time. 
Create a pool that can be claimed and released from an interface.
An option would be to set them up as Jenkins agents.
