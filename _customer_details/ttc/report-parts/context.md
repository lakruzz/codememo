This report summarizes the findings of a Continuous Delivery assessment performed for Universal Robots(UR) in November 2016.

The workshop took place at Universal Robots own premises in Odense.

UR is producing robot arms, based on collaborative robot technology, to help production staff streamline repetitive processes in a safe manner. They produce the entire software stack needed for the robot arms. From the operating system, which is unix based, all the way to the user interface.

## The Continuous Delivery Assessment

The Continuous Delivery (CoDe) assessment has the purpose of getting a complete overview of the organization with specific focus on software development, the tool stack that surrounds and supports it and the processes used to develop, verify, deploy, test and release software.

The goal of the assessment is two-fold:

 * To raise awareness in the software development team of some of the best practice methods, tools and processes available for improving efficiency and producing higher quality software.
 * To outline a roadmap as a practical guide to achieving this goal.

Awareness is achieved by conducting a considerable part of the assessment as workshops and facilitated discussions with the developers in the software team.

The roadmap is manifested in the report you are currently reading.

## This report

The report is structured around the Continuous Delivery Maturity Model which was presented to all participants during the workshop. The chapters in the report reflect the focus areas in the model.

Throughout the report, findings and observations are given their own section header and paragraphs under each section are marked with an up-arrow __&#xf0aa;__{: style="font-family:FontAwesome;" } indicating that it contains a recommended action mitigating an issue.

Mitigation's are tagged with a prioritization (M, S, C or W in parentheses).
These letters represent Praqma’s recommendation of priority for the suggested actions.

Higher priorities can indicate both great value or "low-hanging fruits".

The lettering refers to the _MoSCoW principle_ for prioritization:

* __Must have__
A condition that must be satisfied in the final solution for the solution to be considered a success.
* __Should have__
A condition that should be included in the solution if it is possible. A critical condition indeed but not discriminating for success if left out.
* __Could have__
A condition that could be included if time and resources permit. It is considered desirable but not strictly necessary for success.
* __Won’t have__ (not used in this report)
A condition that is not currently relevant and which will not be implemented but could potentially become relevant in a future scope.

The prioritization that we have come up with is meant to be a catalyst for your internal discussions - you may not agree with our priorities in which case you should obviously go with your own.

Each section is designed as a standalone piece so that the suggested remedies and improvements can be applied independently.
This approach should enable you to copy most sections marked with __&#xf0aa;__{: style="font-family:FontAwesome;" } directly into JIRA and prioritize them.
All you need to do hereafter is to groom the task, estimate the work, and put it on your backlog.
