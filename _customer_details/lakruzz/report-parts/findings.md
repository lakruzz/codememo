The findings and recommendations have mainly been picked up throughout the  two days of the workshop. We conducted this part as targeted group interviews focusing on the 6 main areas of the maturity model.

On the first day, after the initial Continuous Delivery presentation, we had an exercise where all attendees together were asked to illustrate the process from the point where a requirement or a change request arrives until the implemented result can be accessed by the end-users. 

The participants were also equipped with stickers with 6 different pictograms representing: Wait state, unplanned work, manual work, conflicts, queued work and anything that needs repair.

The result was discussed during the workshop and then used as a reference point during the various discussions on the following day.
