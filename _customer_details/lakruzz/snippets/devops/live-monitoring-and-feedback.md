### Collaborating with end users is difficult

The collaboration with distributors, installers and end users is currently handled mainly via emails by the Front Office team. 
There are many layers of communication between end user and R&D, lacking any tool support besides email.

#### Implement a customer collaboration tool with integration to Jira (S)

Have a standardized interface to customers that integrates with Jira.
Allow customers to open tickets or issues, either directly or by proxy through a collaboration tool. 
This will help increase the traceability, allowing you to track code changes all the way back to customer issues.
