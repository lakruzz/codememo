### Single points of failure on key resources

We identified some _bus factor_ issues in DevOps, release management and security reviews. 
Although DevOps themselves found it to be an issue, the severity of the problem is hard to determine.

Another area where this could be an issue are the 'Go2Guys' and heroes.
During the workshops, it was mentioned *you get into this category if you have been in UR for approximately two years*. 
It could be argued that this is a two year on-boarding process.

#### Broaden competences (S)

It's recommended to have at least two to three available resources to cover each competence area.
This helps avoid business critical situations during key person absence.

#### Simplify your entire setup (S)

Evaluating your entire software development process, as you have obviously committed to doing, will definitely help with this, given improvements are actually implemented. 
It will be easier for everyone to understand the bigger picture, but also facilitates diving into process details if needed.

#### Automate your processes (S)

The most effective way to implement a process is to program it.
Document your processes into scripts, rather than into manuals.
You may document any remaining processes, but time is better spent implementing than documenting.
