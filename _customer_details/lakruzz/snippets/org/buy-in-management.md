### Little data available on spent or wasted resources during development

Currently, there is little data on the amount of resources spent on unplanned work and slow feedback loops. 
These are hidden costs that make it difficult to create business cases (cost-benefit) for investments.

#### Start measuring the work that shouldn't have to do (S)

It is important to quantify efforts wasted due to wait states or queued and unplanned work.

Some examples could be:

- Resources spent on tasks after 'commit-stop'                                
- The time it takes for a commit to get integrated into the mainline
- The time it takes for a commit on mainline to become available for end users
- Resources spent on correcting domain software errors

It's important to create metrics in areas which might need improvements in order to measure if the actions taken also have the desired effect.


### Ad-hoc approach to maintenance and improvements

There seems to be a general feeling among the development teams that continuous improvement and paying off technical debt should be a hidden task. 
This results in a _glue quality on_ approach and may actually be creating more problems than it solves.

#### Make the required work visible (M)

Paying off technical debt and making improvements gives **value** and should not be hidden, it's important! 
Without deliberately planning and doing this type of work, you'll never be able to realize the desired speed and quality improvements. 
Worse, it'll probably slow you down over time.

Create visible Jira tasks for such improvements. 
Prioritize them and plan them into the sprints, just like any other development task. 

#### Communicate commitment in real work (M)

Management should communicate commitment to improving the processes. 
A possible way to do this is to theme it in Jira and commit a certain percentage of a sprint to related tasks.

Simply reserve a small percentage of a sprint for tasks focusing on paying off technical debt and making improvements. 
The exact amount of commitment is, of course, up to you. 
Still, this is a great way of communicating commitment, allowing you to handle it like proper planned work.
