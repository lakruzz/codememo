## Get perspective on a tech challenge

Let's grab a coffee or a lunch - In real life - Away From Keyboard.

This is like a free coaching session - we will talk about you and your challenges - not mine. I offer that (professional) shoulder you can cry on. Let go! I'll listen and support you, and offer perspective.

## Get a free workshop for your team

We have a series of workshop and speaks that I have prepared, and done publicly and for free. I'll be happy to do it again. Despite that they are free in the literal meaning "costless" they are not cheap in the meaning "inferior" or "low quality". Quite the opposite, they showcase the seriousness and high quality I aim for in my engagement.

I offer them as a private V.I.P. session. Only condition is that you sign up min 6 people (no max!) and that you set aside time to both prepare well before the workshop, and evaluate with me after.
