## Privacy Policy

This site is operated from an obligation and dedication to protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of it's user's data, including personal data. I'm careful in on ensuring compliance with applicable data protection legislation, first and foremost the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## Editor in Chief

The Editor in Chief is me - Lars Kruse. If you have any questions about the data policy presented here, or if you need to report content you've found on these pages; please do not hesitate to [reach out to a me](mailto:lars@lakruzz.com){: target="_blank"}

## lakruzz.com is not a business

This is a personally driven - non-profit - site. On these pages each author speaks with her or his own tone-of-voice. On these pages the editors are dedicated to sharing information and growing a community - not running a business. All material on theses pages is free. I deliberately use _authors_ in plural, as I may host material from others too, but I remain the Editor in Chief. I take the responsibility.

The main purpose is to expose and facilitate my _personal_ passion for utilizing technology and digital solutions to drive meaningful outcomes for people. I love to share knowledge and experience with others. Most people in tech do. Therefore the stories have interactive discussions enabled, and you are encouraged to join and set your mark - all it takes is a GitHub Account.

## Data controller

This site processes data - consequently I consider myself a data processor.  Although not strictly required in relations between private individuals I take on this role in compliancy with he GDPR rule set.

My interpretation on maintaining this role is based on the EU commission's [adequacy decision](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3721){: target="_blank"} which clarifies that for US companies that has signed the EU-US [Data Privacy Framework program](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/){: target="_blank"} and which offers [Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC)](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en){: target="_blank"}
that have been “pre-approved” by the European Commission, the legal implication of utilizing services from US based companies is considered _adequate_ to be fully comparable with that of obtaining similar services from EU based companies.

I carefully monitor, that I do not utilize services from US based companies unless they have signed the Data Privacy Framework program and offer SCCs in compliance with the EU Commission's recommendations.

As an example: I have a paid account with GitHub. As part of this contract I've accepted GitHub's _Standard Contractual Clauses_ which are aligned with the EU commissions recommendations. GitHub has signed the _Data Privacy Framework program_ therefore; When I host these page on GitHub pages it's in compliance with the EU commission's recommendation of data transfer to 3<sup>rd</sup> party countries outside EU.

Same logic follows for the Google Analytics tags I use, since Google also offer terms that are compliant with the EU SCCs and they too signed the Data Privacy Framework program.

## The cookies we set

- I set one cookie of my own, to track that you answered 'yes' to use the site and let us use cookies
- I set two Google Analytics cookies, that helps me with insights into _how_ the guests browse the website but I guarantee that I do not collect an _Personally identifiable information (PII)_ about _who_ you are.

## The site does not collect any PII data

Personally identifiable information (PII) is a legal term used to define any data that can be used to identify someone. On this specific low-fidelity site all data I track is anonymized and I do not elicit _any_ kind of PII data - not even you IP address.

## Embedded pages, services and redirects to other services

Occasionally this site may use embedded pages (`<iframe>`) or include other services (`<script>`). For instance that is the case for the ability to leave comments on the pages. The comments are hosted by GitHub. And pages may also embed Google maps, or redirect to external sites, such as Meetup.com to signup to events.

On these external pages, embedded or redirected, you choose yourself, at your own will, wether you want to sign in or not. How you act and behave on these other pages and services - is considered outside the scope of this data policy you are reading here.

Also note, that on external pages, there might be functional cookies set. When that is the case, these are beyond the scope of the cookie consent you have given to _this_ website.

If you find scripts running or cookies set in the scope of this website that you would like to question, then I'm happy top explain what's going on - reach out to me: [the Editor in Chief](maintlo:lars@lakruzz.com){: target="_blank"}.
