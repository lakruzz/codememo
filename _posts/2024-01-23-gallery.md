This model [originates](/about-model) from the time when I founded and operated Praqma. In this post, I'll describe how I conducted this Continuous Delivery Metric Assessment at mor then 25 companies
{: .kicker}

I've gathered a handful af pictures from some of the workshops and the first pile is from the initial part of the session where we do a Value Stream Map. It's a _rich picture_ we draw on the wall, everyone involved in the process has a pen, and we're mapping what exactly goes on while the software is produced, validated and shipped.

## Value Stream Mapping
{% include gallery id="valuestream" caption="The workshop starts with mapping out the Value Stream of the product" %}

When the Value Stream begins to take form we introduce the _trouble markers_ which the participants use to mark where the process needs to be optimization in six different categories of troubles:

- **Manual Work** (dull, repetitive work done my humans)
- **Queues** (processes where takt is off due to lack of resources)
- **Wait states** (processes where flow is broken - often during handovers. Tasks are dropped between chairs. What is important to someone is unimportant to someone else)
- **Conflicts** (parties fighting each other, serving different contradicting agendas)
- **Unplanned work** (prioritization and systemic approach is soo poorly adapted, that plans fall apart all the time. It's fire fighting)
- **Needs repair** (Processes are adapted to a certain situation, but the world has moved on. These processes needs to be updated)

## Some board examples
{% include gallery id="boards" caption="The mappings show the troubles in the process and and all the painful back-loops" %}

When the Value stream is mapped and assessed we ask the team to prepare a walk-through of what goes on in the board. One person will start in the upper left corner and explain all the processes, troubles, connection, and back-loops.

It's very seldom that there exists such a person that has the full overview of the entire process. During the walk-through new team members will have to take over. No one grasps the full picture.

## Full picture walk-through
{% include gallery id="fullpicture" caption="The mappings show the troubles in the process and and all the painful back-loops" %}

After the Value Stream mapping session we present the model and ask the team to score each card from a miraculous point of view:

>_Imagine that the principle described on the card was fully implemented in your process. How much would it affect [throughput, feedback and payback](/gauges/) â€” and how complex would the implementation be_

So we spread out in smaller teams and each team picks up a couple of cards of their own choice. Each card is scored for effect and cost of implementation. The processes continues until all cards are scored and assessed. The team must agree and debate the scores to get to some level on consensus.


## Scoring the cards in the model
{% include gallery id="score" caption="The workshop starts with mapping out the Value Stream of the product" %}


This concludes the first day of the workshop. The follows a series of workshops often on in each of the six areas, where we use a lean coffee workshop format to dive into the the problems identified and the possible solutions that would remedy them. We also join the teams in their everyday work processes and observe and interview to gather perspective.

The findings are then recorded and presented as a details adn customized note on each card - see card ["Automated Builds"](/automated-builds/) as an example.
