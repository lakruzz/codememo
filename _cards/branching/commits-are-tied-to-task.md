Every time the code changes, it traces back to _some_ task being done.
Think about it; Who's feeding the process? How are tasks being created, prioritized and executed?

When a code change cannot be tied to a specific task, it's likely something that has bypassed the normal chain of command. Somebody is working outside protocol.

Make all code changes part of an overall plan - simply pair commits with tasks. Besides generating valuable traces that can later be used in an audit or documentation of your trail, it also enables you to track the pace of the team and maintain a burn-down chart.
