Distributed version control systems are a faster, modern alternative with a healthy community. Due to its distributed nature, switching to git opens up many doors to automation.
e.g.: It allows for automation tools to work in a local repository without jeopardizing the mainline.

Keep your project's history clean and understandable. Make it easier to find specific commits and for others to review.  When finishing up work in your short-lived branches, clean up your local commit history before merging back into the integration branch.
