*Versioning schemes are a powerful tool.*
<br><br>They give you a quick and accurate reference to when, where and by whom something was made, what it's compatible with, etc.   
It is the name of your release, the identifier of your component, the passport of your product.<br><br>
Implement a well-defined versioning scheme for your components and releases.
