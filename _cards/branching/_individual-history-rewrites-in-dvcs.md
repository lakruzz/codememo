When finishing up work in your short-lived branches, clean up your local commit history before merging back into the integration branch.

Make sure every commit represents a single fix or feature milestone.

Squash away commits like "fixed typo", "forgot to commit foo.js", "fixed bar.cs indentation".

This helps keep your project's history clean, understandable, makes it easier to find specific commits and for others to review.
