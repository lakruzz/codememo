All branches but the integration branch are ideally short-lived and often revolve around a single task.

Once the task is completed, the branch is merged back into the mainline and the development branch has ceased it's purpose.

The aim is to merge every created branch back into the mainline eventually, sooner rather than later.

Merging is done frequently and fearlessly by developers or even better, completely automated.
