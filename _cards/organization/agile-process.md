Agile processes defies phases in the software development process. The 1st principle in the Agile Manifesto refers to _continuously delivering software_.  

An agile approach is not a small waterfall or a interactive and incremental process speeded up to 14 days intervals. It literally has no phases - only continuous integration and continuous delivery with focus on minimizing work in progress and get the right thing done - at a constant pace.
