Initiatives, new tools and approaches are often of natural interest to developers and they might experiment and research without explicitly being told to do so.

But Continuous Delivery is a paradigm that strives to build quality into the product rather than gluing it on afterwards.

Transitioning is going to take time. It needs planning. It needs prioritization. It needs funding. You need a road map. Continuous Delivery is not a quilted patchwork. Be sure to make it a corporate thing, not just a neat idea.
