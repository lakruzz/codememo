Assignments should be prepared for working before they qualify as actual tasks. The goal of a task must be known to the person who is implementing it.

If a task is ambiguous it can not be estimated, and if it can not be estimated, it can not be prioritized.

If a task doesn't have a clear definition of done, then it should be time-boxed.
