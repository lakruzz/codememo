Whether or not a particular code snippet gets tested is often a matter of how easy it _is_ to test.

Organize your code in easily accessible features. Make each feature available through one interface only.

Since the feature is only available through one interface, it's safe to consider it tested, when you have massaged it.

At the end of the day, more code gets tested.
