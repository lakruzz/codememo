Reviewing code can be justified both from a Quality Assurance perspective and from a knowledge spread perspective. 
Reviews can improve code readability and efficiency, intercept bugs and serve as a means to educate your newbies and juniors.

However, reviews can also be a source of both _unplanned_ and _queued_ work.
If not organized carefully, reviews can be a huge bottleneck in your software development process.

Take care and understand the difference between _verification_ and _validation_ automate as much as possible before spending any time at all on validation.
