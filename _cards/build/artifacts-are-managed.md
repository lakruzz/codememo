An _artifact_ is _the output derived from your build process_.

Sadly, artifacts are often built whenever they're needed.
A lot of the builds just build that which has been built before.

Even though this could be about contributing to avoiding the environmental crisis, it is also justifiable to save and manage artifacts simply to save wait-states and bottlenecks in the software development process.

Stop building things that haven't changed and start reusing colleagues' artifacts - install an artifact management system.
