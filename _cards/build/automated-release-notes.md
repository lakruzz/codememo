Whenever you ship a new release you probably need a release note, a report listing the new version number, fixed issues, new features...

Why write all that manually? By building up your traces and recording your trails as you work, you can pull all this information out of your backend automatically.

You've written your last release note. From here on out it's release notes _as code_.
