Split up your builds and verifications into a pipeline consisting of multiple stages. 
Use this approach to keep your builds as fast as possible, your feedback loop as short as possible and your developers notified as quickly as possible despite having long-running builds.

In your pipeline, each step provides more confidence in your code than the previous one.
