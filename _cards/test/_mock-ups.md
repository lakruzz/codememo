Using mock-ups, stubs, fakes and proxies in your tests makes them faster, more efficient and more to-the-point.

Test your unit, not its dependencies. Replace dependencies with light-weight deterministic fakes.

Use a framework to generate the mock-ups. A mocking framework will not only drastically increase the quality of your tests, it will also make it easier and faster to write new, high quality tests. And the better structured your code is, the better mock-ups you get, so it's actually also a natural encouragement to writer better code.
