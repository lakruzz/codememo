## Create a fork or branch

## Organize notes in cards, summary and context

## Get out of your notes and into the report

Get findings headers and mitigation headers from your notes into your report.

Mark _every single section_ that needs to be written with

    :TODO:

It's important that you mark every section, so you can actually search for todos in your project.

## Write the findings and mitigations

## Add new cards if needed

## Add pictures
