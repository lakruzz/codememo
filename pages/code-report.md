## The Continuous Delivery Assessment

The Continuous Delivery (CoDe) assessment has the purpose of getting a 360 degree overview of Napatech  with specific focus on the software, the tool stack that surrounds and supports it and the processes used to develop, verify, deploy, test and release it.

The goal of the assessment is two-fold:

* To create awareness in the software development team on some of the best practices, tools and processes, that can inspire to become more efficient and produce higher quality with lower cost.
* A lay-out of a practical roadmap that can be used as a guide to achieve this goal going forward.

The awareness is achieved by conducting a considerable part of the assessment as a workshop and facilitated discussions with active participation of the developers in the software team.

The roadmap is manifested in the report
