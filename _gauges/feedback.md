Continuous attention to your surroundings will provide you with the means for you to reflect upon your current situation. Think - and then improve it.

Feedback can be in the form of logs, data, graphs, statistics, analysis, discussions with customers or colleagues - Anything that gives your surroundings a voice.

If your Continuous Delivery ecosystem or your application isn't _talking_ to you, then you're trying to move forward while blindfolded, in the dark.

Give your surroundings a voice.

For each card ask yourself the following question:

> To what extent would implementing this feature or ability provide more feedback or visibility to the responsible worker and his colleagues?

The feedback is measured from one to three stars. Use the stars as follows:

{% include func/stars.html star_count=1 %}

It sporadically affects the developer at an individual level.

{% include func/stars.html star_count=2 %}

It affects the entire team and collaboration.

{% include func/stars.html star_count=3 %}

It affects us, beyond the project, at a corporate level.
