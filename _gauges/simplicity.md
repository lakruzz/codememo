Complexity is everywhere. Simplicity is the opposite of that.

In a standard approach to software development, simplicity is the meter that outweighs all others.

The simpler a solution is to implement, the faster the _Return On Investment_.

To clarify your prioritization, take the sum of your _throughput_, _feedback_ and _payback_ scores and multiply by simplicity. That's how important simplicity is!

For each card ask yourself the following question:

> What would be required to implement this feature or ability, taking into account man hours, money spent up front, and ongoing cost of ownership?

The simplicity is measured from one to three stars. Use the stars as follows:

{% include func/stars.html star_count=1 %}

This is the size of a _project_. It not only involves the team, but _the line organization itself_. It requires funding and _approval from upper management_.

{% include func/stars.html star_count=2 %}

Several people will have to be involved, either for implementation, research or planning. Implementation is _at least a week of focused work_ and there may be expenses up front.

{% include func/stars.html star_count=3 %}

It can be implemented by _one person_ in _less than a week of focused work_. Investment other than actual labour is minimal.
