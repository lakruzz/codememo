Complexity is everywhere.

In a standard approach to software development, complexity is the meter that influences all others.

The simpler a solution is to implement, the faster the _Return On Investment_.

For each card ask yourself the following question:

> What would be required to implement this feature or ability, taking into account man hours, money spent up front, and ongoing cost of ownership?


{% include func/stars.html star_count=1 %} The first level of complexity is something an individual can do within project scope. It's marked as a low hanging fruit <i class="fa-solid fa-apple-whole"/>.

{% include func/stars.html star_count=2 %} The second level of complexity is something that can be achieved as a team effort, still within a project scope. It's marked as a team effort <i class="fa-solid fa-user-group"/>.

{% include func/stars.html star_count=3 %} The third and highest level of complexity is something than can only be achieved with permission and funding from the line-organization. It's too big for the project to handle within it's own means and resources. It's marked as a mountain to climb <i class="fa-solid fa-mountain-sun"/> .
