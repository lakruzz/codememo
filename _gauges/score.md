The card score is calculated based on the values of the gauges.

The algorithm used is:

    (throughput + feedback + payback)

Each card is also assessed for complexity, you should pay attention to the cost of implementation: 

<i class="fa-solid fa-apple-whole"/> It's a low hanging fruit.

<i class="fa-solid fa-user-group"/> It's as a team effort.

<i class="fa-solid fa-mountain-sun"/> It's a mountain to climb.
