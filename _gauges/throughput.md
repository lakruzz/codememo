An interesting measure to focus on is simply speed or throughput.
The time it takes from a developer proudly shouting "It works on my computer!" to it actually working on the end user's computer.

For each card ask yourself the following question:

> To what extent would implementing this feature or ability improve the overall throughput of my pipeline?

The feedback is measured from one to three stars. Use the stars as follows:

{% include func/stars.html star_count=1 %}

The improvement can be counted in _minutes_.

{% include func/stars.html star_count=2 %}

The improvement can be counted in _hours_.

{% include func/stars.html star_count=3 %}

The improvement can be counted in _days_.
