# Usage: ./gh-login.sh {initialize|postcreate}"
#
# Purpose: To allow the devcontainer to authenticate with GitHub CLI without user interaction
#
# Designed to run as an initializeCommand in a devcontainer.json file
# This script will check if the host is authenticated with GitHub CLI
# If so it will store the base64 encoded token in the _temp.token file
# for a later postCreateCommand to use to authenticate the devcontainer with GitHub CLI
# 
# To get the benefits of this script, you must have the following in your devcontainer.json file:
#
#   "initializeCommand": "./.devcontainer/gh-login.sh initialize",
#   "postCreateCommand": "./.devcontainer/gh-login.sh postcreate",


# Failure is not an option:
